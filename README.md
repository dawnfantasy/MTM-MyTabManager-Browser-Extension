# MTM-MyTabManager-Browser-Extension
My Tab Manager is a Chrome/Edge extension to organize, save, and manage your browser tabs effortlessly.

It runs locally, no account linking, no cloud sync, nothing online.

With a three-panel interface, it lets you handle live tabs and stored collections via intuitive drag-and-drop actions.


# How to Use
Install:
Currently only local install in developer mode.

Open:
New tab (Ctrl+T)
or
Click the Tab Manager icon in your toolbar.

# Panels

Right: See live groups (windows) and live cards (tabs). Sort ("S"), hibernate ("H"), or close ("X").

Middle: View/edit stored cards in a selected collection. Drag live cards here to save (and close it with Shift key pressed).

Left: Create and manage groups/collections with "+". Drag to reorder.


# Key Actions

Click live cards to switch to the actual tab.

Drag live cards to collections to save, or to live groups to move.

Click stored cards or drag one to live groups to open URLs.

Export/import collections with the toolbar buttons.

Hiberate will save the window to a special collection and close it afterwards.
